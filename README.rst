Example Project for django-simple-menu
======================================

This is a complete example project for django-simple-menu that can be quickly
used to evaluate if django-simple-menu is right for you.

Setting up
----------

To setup the project you need to create a new virtualenv directory and install
the dependencies listed in the requirements file::

    virtualenv testenv
    source testenv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Next setup the Django instance::

    ./manage.py syncdb

And finally run the project::

    ./manage.py runserver

Once you access the project at http://127.0.0.1:8000 you will see a menu that
will change depending on if you're logged in, logged in as a staff member or
logged in as a superuser. To fully see the menu system in action you will need
to login to the Django admin and create two new users (one just a staff member
and the other a regular user, you already have a superuser from the syncdb
call) and then login with all three of them to compare the resulting menus.
