<p>IATE (= &ldquo;Inter-Active Terminology for Europe&rdquo;) is the EU&#39;s inter-institutional terminology database.
    IATE has been used in the EU institutions and agencies since summer 2004 for the collection,
    dissemination and shared management of EU-specific terminology. The project partners are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>European Commission</li>
    <li>Parliament Council</li>
    <li>Court of Justice</li>
    <li>Court of Auditors</li>
    <li>Economic & Social Committee</li>
    <li>Committee of the Regions</li>
    <li>European Central Bank</li>
    <li>European Investment Bank</li>
    <li>Translation Centre for the Bodies of the EU</li>
</ul>
<p>The project was launched in 1999 with the objective of providing a web-based infrastructure for all EU terminology resources,
    enhancing the availability and standardisation of the information. IATE incorporates all of the existing
    terminology databases of the EU&rsquo;s translation services into a single new,
    highly interactive and accessible interinstitutional database. The following legacy databases have been imported into IATE,
    which now contains approximately 1.4 million multilingual entries:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Eurodicautom (Commission),</li>
    <li>TIS (Council),</li>
    <li>Euterpe (EP),</li>
    <li>Euroterms (Translation Centre),</li>
    <li>CDCTERM (Court of Auditors),</li>
</ul>
